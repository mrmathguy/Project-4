# Overview

The project aimed to develop and evaluate a stock prediction model, colloquially named the "John Stockton Model," using machine learning techniques. The model leverages a neural network trained on historical stock data to identify potential buying and selling points. The project's primary objectives included:

- Model Development: Training a neural network to predict stock price movements and strategically identify opportune moments for buying or selling.

- Strategy Comparison: Comparing the performance of the John Stockton Model against a traditional "buy and hold" strategy for a selected set of stocks.

- Statistical Analysis: Conducting statistical tests to assess the significance of differences in outcomes between the two strategies.

The workflow involved data preprocessing, model training, and simulation of trading strategies. The comparison was visualized through a bar chart, showcasing the relative performance of the John Stockton Model and the buy and hold strategy.

The project's findings contribute insights into the efficacy of machine learning-based stock prediction models in comparison to conventional investment strategies. The comparison's statistical significance provides a basis for evaluating the practical implications of adopting such models in real-world investment scenarios.
